# Archived!

I'm archiving this - since I wrote this version, webpack and other things have changed a lot.

I have a newer version which works with es6 directly in the browser, that's a lot cleaner - I'll push that soon.

Korny's metrics vizualisation stuff - D3 UI

This is a work in progress and in no way ready for sharing!

Requires webpack. This can be installed globally with `npm install webpack -g`.

To run, run `npm start` - you'll need the metrics_server running on port 3000 though.  Then this will maybe show something on port 8080
